CloudSec Tidbits is a blogpost series showcasing interesting bugs found by Doyensec during cloud security testing activities.
Weâ€™ll focus on times when the cloud infrastructure is properly configured, but the web application fails to use the services correctly.

Each blogpost will discuss a specific vulnerability resulting from an insecure combination of web and cloud related technologies. Every article will include an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) laboratory that can be easily deployed to experiment with the described vulnerability.
